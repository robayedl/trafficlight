# trafficlight
At a cross section of four way roads there are a set of lights (Red, Yellow and Green) for signals to control the traffic. Each road will be open for some time when only the green light is on. When the red light is on no vehicle is allowed to run on that road. The yellow light will be turned on for few seconds between the change of red to green or green to red in any set.
